Part 1.

Simulate series of motions.
How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?


type Coords = (Int, Int
type HeadTailCoords = (Coords, Coords)

modelMotion :: Motion -> State -> State

modelState :: ? -> State -> State

I need to store positions of the tail visited at least once. In a list. For last visualisation check.

How do we "animate" motion steps?
- fold?
