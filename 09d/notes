Part 1.

Simulate series of motions.
How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?


type Coords = (Int, Int
type HeadTailCoords = (Coords, Coords)

modelMotion :: Motion -> State -> State

modelState :: ? -> State -> State

I need to store positions of the tail visited at least once. In a list. For last visualisation check.

How do we "animate" motion steps?
+ fold?


Part 2.

You now must simulate a rope consisting of ten knots.


Not all knots will be moved at motion (if stepNumber is less than number of knots).


Thinking lists for new KnotsCoords.

Is map a better option? Vector? Both definitely more suited for updates and lookups.

How to still work pairs in animate?
