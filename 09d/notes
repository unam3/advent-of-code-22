Part 1.

Simulate series of motions.
How many positions does the tail of the rope visit at least once?


type Coords = (Int, Int
type HeadTailCoords = (Coords, Coords)

modelMotion :: Motion -> State -> State

modelState :: ? -> State -> State

I need to store positions of the tail visited at least once. In a list. For last visualisation check.

How do we "animate" motion steps?
+ fold?


Part 2.

You now must simulate a rope consisting of ten knots.


Not all knots must be moved in vanimate: only ones which required touching rule.
How this rule can be represented in conditions?
- overlapping is when same x and y coordinates.
- touching is when difference between x-s and y-s is less or equal than 1.



Thinking lists for new KnotsCoords.

Is map a better option? Vector? Both definitely more suited for updates and lookups.


Fix vmodelMotion [R 5, U 8, L 4] error in animate.
Take a look at L3 results (l3, l4_rhpi_5 files). Seems like we're not directly moving to the left with 6-knot.
follow function should be implemented
