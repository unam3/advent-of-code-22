Part 1.


How many trees are visible from outside the grid?

1. All of the trees around the edge of the grid are visible.
    countTreesAroundEdge
2. Consider interior trees.
    findInteriorVisibleTrees
- simple brute force

3. Implement countTreesVisibleFromOutside


Part 2.

Implement getScenicScore.

    - modify isTreeVisibleFrom* to be able to check custom folding function to foldl'? dunno. sounds busy. mb at refactoring stage.
    see part1Foldl'Params

    + copypaste and modify isTreeVisibleFrom*
    x compare results of (elems . filterWithKey) with foldlWithKey': do the preserve same order of elements?

What is the highest scenic score possible for any tree?
