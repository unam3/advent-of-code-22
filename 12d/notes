input - heightmap of surrounding area


The heightmap shows the local area from above broken into a grid; the elevation of each square of the grid is given by a single lowercase letter.

a — lowest elevation. z — highest.

S — current position.

E — the location that should get the best signal.


Your current position (S) has elevation a, and the location that should get the best signal (E) has elevation z.


Need to reach E in as few steps as possible.


During each step, you can move exactly one square up, down, left, or right.


Constraint to go higher: elevation of the destination square can be at most one higher than the elevation of your current square: if current elevation is m, you could step to elevation n, but not to elevation o.

The elevation of the destination square can be much lower than the elevation of your current square.


What is the fewest steps required to move from your current position to the location that should get the best signal?
