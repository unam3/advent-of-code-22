Part 1.


Implement instruction parsing in parseInput.

Implement execute function.

Track cycles during execution.

Implement getSignalStrength.

Implement function which will took the number of cycles, executeInstructions and get the signal strength for specified
numbers of cycles.

Extend State type synonym to (RegisterXValue, CycleNumber, [(CycleNumber, Maybe Int)] and inject getSignalStrength into
executeInstrucitons?


For now consider the signal strength (the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register).

Find the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles.

What is the sum of these six signal strengths?


Prediction: in Part II cycles will be messed up somehow.
