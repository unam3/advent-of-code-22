Part 1.


Implement instruction parsing in parseInput.

Implement execute function.

Track cycles duriong execution.

For now consider the signal strength (the cycle number multiplied by the value of the X register).

Find the signal strength during the 20th, 60th, 100th, 140th, 180th, and 220th cycles.

What is the sum of these six signal strengths?


Prediction: in Part II cycles will be messed up somehow.
