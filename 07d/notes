P1.

Implement parseInput.
After if we go into `cd` command and directoryContent is not empty â€” we should assign that content to path in fs.
How to store directories and files in FS map?
For files we can store just size. For directories we could just store list of directories and files names.

Find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000.

What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?

Remarks about input.txt:

- no empty dirs: /ls .*\n\$ cd
- no consecutive ls calls: /ls\n\$ ls

Could we go into same dir in cd and get ls of it second time in input.txt?
