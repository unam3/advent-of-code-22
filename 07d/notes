Implement parseInput.
After if we go into `cd` command and directoryContent is not empty â€” we should assign that content to path in fs.

Find all of the directories with a total size of at most 100000.

What is the sum of the total sizes of those directories?

Remarks about input.txt:

- no empty dirs: /ls .*\n\$ cd
- no consecutive ls calls: /ls\n\$ ls

Could we go into same dir in cd and get ls of it second time in input.txt?
