+ Implement parseInput.
    + divide input lines into tuple of two strings
+ Implement relation between item types and priority (zip?)
+ Find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack.
    Data.List.intersect
+ What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?

P2.

+ Implement parseInputP2: parse in triplets: String -> [(String, String, String)]
+ Find the item type that corresponds to the badges of each three-Elf group: Data.List.intersect
    We do not need repeating items, so we will use nub in parseInput2
+ What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?
